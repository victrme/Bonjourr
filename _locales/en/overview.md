Every time you open a new window or tab, you'll be greeted by this minimalist looking page that will help your serenity and productivity. Thanks to its gorgeous high quality backgrounds that change according to the mood of the day, your new tabs will always feel fresh.

Bonjourr was built as a more modern alternative to homepages like Momentum. We took inspiration from iOS and Apple's design language to create this beautiful homepage that will help you focus on what matters.

Here's some key features:
🍏 iOS design language
🏞 Dynamic 4K backgrounds that change according to the mood of the day
⚡️ Fast & lightweight!
🔎 Search bar (compatible with all search engines)
🕰 Analog clock with multiple clock faces
🌤 Weather
🔗 Quick Links
👋 Greets you by your name
🌘 Dark mode
🥖 Emoji as favicon
🧑‍💻 Custom CSS styling
📝 Custom fonts
🔒 Privacy focused
🌎 Multilingual

Bonjourr aims to look and feel minimal, while still bringing you lots of options to customise it to your liking. Set your own backgrounds (or Unsplash collections!), enable the beautiful analog clock, set your own font and Quick Links... You can even check out our documentation where we compiled some style snippets to do even more.

The project is entirely open source, developer friendly and actually respects your privacy. We do not collect any data, nor do you need to create an account to use it.

🏞 Dynamic 4K backgrounds
We handpicked some of the most beautiful Unsplash photos so that your new tabs will always feel fresh. Discover high quality photos of incredible landscapes, animals and nature.

⚡️ Fast & lightweight!
Bonjourr is built with vanilla JavaScript and optimised for the best possible performance.

🔎 Search bar
The integrated search bar of Bonjourr is compatible with all search engines. Yes, all of them! If you want, you can even add you own custom search engine.

🕰 Analog clock
Bonjourr's default clock is made to resemble what you have on the iPhone and other iOS devices. But if you'd like something more exotic, you can replace it with a very cool analog clock, and customise it as you'd like.

🌤 Weather
In a simple sentence, get a summary of you local current weather and forecast.

🔗 Quick Links
It wouldn't be a real homepage without bookmarks! Bonjourr allows you to add your own bookmarks, change their icons and import your current bookmarks from your browser.

🌘 Dark mode
Just like on iOS, Bonjourr has a beautiful automatic dark mode.

🔒 Privacy focused
Some homepages like Momentum encourage you to create an account, give them some personal info, use more permissions and rely on many third party services. Bonjourr doesn’t collect any data, even for analytics purposes, use minimal permissions, rely on fewer third party services and of course doesn’t have any account system. Bonjourr being open source also means that you can easily check out if our claims are true.

🧑‍💻 Custom CSS styling
Have a specific idea in mind? Bonjourr has you covered with the custom styles section. You can customise and do anything when you add your own CSS.

📝 Custom fonts
Want a specific font on your homepage ? You can easily select it thanks to Bonjourr's integration with Google Fonts.

🌎 Multilanguage
Thanks to our awesome contributors, Bonjourr is available in more than 20 different languages.
